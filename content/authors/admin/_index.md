#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi!üëã I am a first-year master's student at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Longbo Huang] (https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/). Prior to my master's study, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/).

I'm currently focused on abstract visual reasoning tasks üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è, such as the [ARC-AGI Challenge] (https://arcprize.org/), and actively investigating solutions spanning multimodal LLM reasoning, neuro-symbolic methods, and beyond. I believe tackling problems like these can uncover new pathways toward advancing AGI. If you're interested in collaborating‚Äîor just exchanging ideas‚Äîfeel free to reach out!
